========== Assumptions =====================

1. I Assumed that only one log file is copied into the folder everytime. The application just picks a file from the path and doesnt delete the file.

2. If the file has a mismatch of start and finish logs count which means their counter parts are missing and may be available in the next file. 
Hence the log that is orphan(like start missing its finish vice versa), is still retained in a Map in the program.

3. Although there was a problem creating a file of larger memory, this program has been tested for the file of size 200Mb.

4. There can still be lot of junit test cases written. In the interest of time, I wrote only few.
